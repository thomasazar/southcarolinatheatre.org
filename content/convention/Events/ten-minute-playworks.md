  title: "Submit Your Play"
---
Welcome to the new school year/season! Now that our batteries are recharged, and our imaginations are brimming with energy it is TIME to get WRITING! SCTA is looking for submissions for this year’s Ten Minute Playworks. We encourage all members to submit their original ten minute plays to be considered for the SCTA 2019 Convention.

Selected plays will be presented in staged readings at the convention in November which will be cast and rehearsed on site. After the staged readings, playwrights, directors, and cast will receive a response from a working professional to encourage growth and development of the writing.

**Teachers:** this is a great opportunity for student playwrights to gain valuable experience with the process of script writing and for them to bolster that resume.

**Professionals:** this is a wonderful opportunity for your work to be showcased in front of a multitude of South Carolina theatre artists.

So....get writing and encourage those budding playwrights to get busy creating!

## Guidelines for Submission

* Scripts must be submitted by October 15, 2018 – check website for submissions information.
* Only one submission per playwright, please.
* Only **unproduced** works will be accepted.
* Plays that have had staged readings ARE eligible.
* No adaptations, musicals, or children’s plays.
* Cast size maximum: 4
* Length: 10 minutes, no minimum. This means 10 pages or less. Scripts that exceed 10 pages may be eliminated from consideration.
* Settings should be simple, no more than one locale.
* Please submit a cover letter with synopsis and resume (if you are a student and don’t have a resume, that’s fine!) along with one copy of the play.
* Standard play format required. (Samples [here](https://shop.samuelfrench.com/content/files/upload/General%20SFI%20Formatting%20Guidelines%20Complete.pdf) and [here](https://www.playwriting101.com/).) Cover sheet of play should have title, author, author’s address, author’s telephone number, and author’s email address (if available).
* The work must have a beginning that grabs your attention, a middle with some meat and character development, and an ending that makes sense. It can surprise you, shock you, make you laugh, make you cry, make you think, but it must have an ending.
* Also ask yourself these questions: Is the dialogue natural for the characters created? Are the characters ones that an audience can hate, love, believe ... is there some emotion touched? Is it something that an audience will remember? Something to tell someone else about? In short, is it a good story?
