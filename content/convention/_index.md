### November 15 – 17, 2019

Each year, South Carolina Theatre Association invites theatre lovers from across the state — actors, singers, dancers, designers, technicians, stage managers, directors, playwrights, teachers, students, professionals, academicians, and more — to gather together in celebration of the art of theatre. The annual SCTA Conference brings over 2,500 members of our theatre community together for three and a half days of workshops, keynotes, performance festivals, auditions, college recruiting, SETC Screening auditions, and more. Join us and share your passion for theatre!
