He is also the CEO of Brian Clowdus Experiences which is taking his environmental work all across the country, expanding at an unprecedented rate.

He has performed and directed in Tokyo, London, Canada, Central and South America, the Caribbean, NYC, LA and in almost every other major city in the United States. Brian was named the Top Artistic Director in Atlanta and one of the Top 20 Atlantans to Watch by Creative Loafing, one of the Top 15 Atlantans under 40 by Atlanta Homes and Lifestyles Magazine, one of the Top 40 Under 40 by Georgia Trend, one of The Most Eligible Bachelors in Atlanta by Jezebel Magazine and most recently one of the Most Influential Atlantans In The Entertainment Industry by Men’s Book Atlanta.

Brian’s work at Serenbe Playhouse and taking his environmental work all across the country exemplifies the theme of this year’s convention, Create Your World.
