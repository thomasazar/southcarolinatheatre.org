The 2018 Community Theatre Festival will once again be a part of SCTA’s Annual Convention, to be held at the School of the Arts at Anderson University, Anderson , South Carolina, from Thursday, November 8 through Sunday, November 11, 2018 . The South Carolina Theatre Association’s annual Community Theatre Festival is being presented at the **Electric City Playhouse** where theatres can meet, greet and compete. Performers will have the opportunity to take a show “on the road.” Our programming team is working diligently to bring the best and brightest speakers and talent for our workshops and events . This year’s convention theme is ***Create Your World***.

The SCTA Community Theatre Festival will be held at the Electric City Playhouse on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, November 9, 10 & 11, and will provide your cast members and attendees more opportunity to take part in the convention. All tech rehearsals, performances, and load-ins will be held on those dates as well. Please note **this is an AACTFest year** and state winners qualify for advancement to SETC. SCTA provides a limited stipend to help defray these costs.
