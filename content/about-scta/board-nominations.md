## Nomination Process

SCTA’s Board of Directors consists of theatre practitioners and business people representing SCTA member organizations or as individuals in good standing. The Nominating Committee, appointed by the President, provides a slate intended to create a balance in terms of background, location, and talents. The Board votes on
the slate and if approved, forwards to the Membership for a final vote at the annual meeting. A Board Member’s term is three years.

## Board Member Duties

Board members are encouraged to take a strong ownership of SCTA and embrace their leadership role. All Board Members are expected to be present at all Board meetings. Prior to each Board meeting, Board Members will receive an agenda with reports in advance of each meeting, and meeting time is spent on action items, strategic discussion and planning activities. A strong Board presence at SCTA functions adds prestige and sets an example for other SCTA members. Board members are expected to participate/attend SCTA programming and annual events whenever possible.

Board Members are also expected to actively participate in the SCTA at a committee level. Each Board member shall sit on at least one committee. In addition, Board Members are asked to frequently consult with the membership of the SCTA so they may be truly representative in their position or to explain Board action or policy.

### Board Meetings

Board meetings are outlined in the SCTA rules. Board Members are expected to be on time to board meetings; the President will make every effort to adjourn the meeting in a timely manner. If a Board Member misses meetings without an excuse deemed valid by the current President, they may be relieved of their duties as a Board member. The Board will be updated regularly and asked to make governance decisions about SCTA operations and finances as well as committee activities. 

### Committee reports

will also be expected from board members as appropriate so that the board may stay apprised of committee news.

### Advocacy

Occasionally, the Board will be asked to take a position on an issue pertaining to theatre and theatre education, as aligned with our mission. The issue may be brought to the Board with a recommendation from a committee or delegated to a related committee for further investigation and/or a recommendation. The Board will review the information and make a decision based on the best interest of the entire Membership.

### Directors’ Fiduciary Responsibility

All Board Members have a fiduciary responsibility to the SCTA, meaning that they are accountable for every financial decision made. Therefore, it is extremely important that Board Members ask questions of the Treasurer, President, and Executive Director in order to fully understand SCTA’s finances.

SCTA carries Director’s and Officer’s insurance to protect Board members.
