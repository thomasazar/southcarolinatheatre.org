title: Where We Stand on Arts Education
---

SCTA believes that arts education is integral to educational excellence. We are represented on the Arts in Basic Curriculum Committee to ensure the voice of theatre artists in education is heard. We know that the arts are essential in learning and they enliven learning in all subject areas.

Education in the arts provides significant opportunities for critical thinking, creative problem solving, skill development, collaborative learning, autonomous judgment, and meaningful community involvement.

The arts provide knowledge of our own cultural heritage and enlighten us about other cultures, past and present.

Moreover, the arts enable students of all ages to address fundamental human issues such as values, feelings, ethics, standards, and social or environmental concerns.
