Each member of SCTA chooses to select one of five divisions to serve as its primary interest:

- Theatre for Youth (which includes Middle School)
- High School Theatre
- Community Theatre
- College & University
- Professional Theatre

Each division works on projects and shares ideas related to its particular needs and interests. SCTA maintains communication within and across divisions. Members may choose to belong to multiple division depending on their interest level. SCTA allows members to demonstrate two areas of interest (primary and secondary), which will determine which newsletters you receive.
