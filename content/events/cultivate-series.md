The South Carolina Theatre Association Executive Board is thrilled to announce their first session in their **Cultivate Series “Celebrating Community in Theatre”** a forum and screening of the documentary film _Janey Makes a Play_. The series was created to connect our members and associates across the state in a variety of educational, networking, and forums.

We are looking for Community Theatres willing to host this “donation only” event at their theatre. It is open to anyone who has an interest in community theatre and learning the story of Janey. This award winning documentary tells the story of 90-year-old Janey as she writes and directs her latest original, socially relevant community theatre production for her small town. Viewers will experience the creative process unfold with a cast of colorful townspeople, as they engage with the arts amidst a local economy devastated by the recent recession. The documentary was written and filmed by Janey’s grandson, Jared who captures the true community in theatre. Participants will share light refreshments and in a pre and post screening discussion about the impact of Community Theatre and specifically how it aims to:

* Bringing people together to be a part of something bigger than ourselves
* Using the powerful medium of storytelling to express what it means to be human
* Participating in and attending theatre as a way to contribute to our community’s education, literacy, and creativity
* Sparking economic revitalization in your own community
