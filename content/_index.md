## 2019 SCTA Convention – Theatre Festival UPDATE

We hope you are all getting excited about the end of the season and school year and making your plans to participate in the 2019 HS Theatre Festival and 2019 Community Theatre at the 2019 Convention.  The Intent to Participate is now open.  We want to remind all high school division teachers and community theatre folks that this year we decided to have a live FACEBOOK drawing for performance space and performance slot.  For High Schools this will be even more fun since we will be utilizing the two (2) festival performance space model which allows us to include more schools in a three day festival format.  Those schools and theatres who complete the Intent to Participate will be billed for festival entry and membership renewal and will be included in the live drawing.
