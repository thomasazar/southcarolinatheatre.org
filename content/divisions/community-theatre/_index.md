The Community Theatre Division of SCTA is committed to connecting, creating, and cultivating community theatre across our beautiful state. We are artists sharpening each other and supporting all the hard work that goes into community theatre. We recognize the exceptional work that comes from community playhouses and organizations across South Carolina. We connect passionate artists and leaders who pour their time and talents into their communities through theatre. We advocate for the success and support of community theatres in SC. Through SCTA’s Community Theatre Division, community theatres and artists can grow, connect, and actively contribute to the greater narrative of theatre in South Carolina!

## How can you get involved with the Community Theatre Division in 2019?

* SCTA’s **Unified Auditions** are scheduled for **February 22-23, 2020 at Greenville Theatre**. The top theatre directors and producers in the area will gather to search for hundreds of actors, designers, and technicians for the 2020-2021 theatre season. Registration for actors and technicians opens December 1, 2019 – stay tuned for details. If your community theatre would like to be involved in casting and hiring, please contact me for more information.

Whether you are part of a community theatre that’s new to SCTA, a veteran organization, or you’re starting a new community theatre, let SCTA’s Community Theatre Division help you connect, cultivate, and create in 2019.

Sincerely,

Noah Taylor\
