Across the state of South Carolina, there are a wide variety of Theatre for Youth programs in many different settings ranging from educational programs in Elementary and Middle schools, all the way up to professional theatre companies producing content for Young Audiences. The goal of each of these programs is to reach out and affect the lives of young people through the power of theatre by providing culturally diverse and bold, curriculum-based performances, workshops and residencies in support of literacy and K-12 learning.

This year we held our very first Theatre for Youth Festival, which was a great success. It featured solo, duet, and group acting and musical performances by Elementary and Middle school students. This year our turnout was wonderful, but our goal next year is to double the amount of schools in attendance, and to provide more workshops and activities for for both students and teachers. We hope next year you will join us at the festival Festival, to be held at Howe Hall AIMS in Goose Creek on April 6, 2019.

SCTA invites you to join us at our annual convention for workshops, networking and so much more. This year “Create Your World” 52nd annual convention will be held November 8 – 11 at the School of the Arts at Anderson University. Don’t forget about our annual awards celebration, date to be determined but we are accepting awards nominations now! And finally, why not consider nominating someone to serve on our Board or a committee. If you want additional information, contact me.

If you find yourself in need of assistance in any capacity, whether it’s with a unit or lesson plan in the classroom, choosing your next show at your school or theatre, or anything else you can think of, please don’t hesitate to get in touch!

Best,
